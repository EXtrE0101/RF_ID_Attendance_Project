In this RFID-based attendance system using Arduino UNO and the MFRC522, multiple RFID cards can be registered in the program, and each card is linked to a specific student’s name. First, you scan each RFID card and note down its unique UID number. These UIDs are then stored inside arrays in the Arduino code along with corresponding student names. When a student places their card near the RFID reader, the module reads the UID and sends it to the Arduino. The program compares the scanned UID with the stored list of valid UIDs. If a match is found, the system marks the student as present, turns on the green LED, and plays a sweet melody using the buzzer to indicate successful attendance. If the scanned UID does not match any stored UID, the system treats it as an unknown card, turns on the red LED, and plays an error sound. This way, the system can handle multiple students efficiently and provide clear visual and audio feedback for valid and invalid cards.
